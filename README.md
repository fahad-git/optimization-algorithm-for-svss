# A Novel Optimization Algorithm for Smart Video Surveillance System and Change Object Detection

Welcome to the repository for my Bachelor's Final Year Project, where I conducted research and developed an **optimization algorithm for a Smart Video Surveillance System (SVSS)**. This project demonstrates a significant contribution to the field of smart surveillance systems by addressing optimization challenges to enhance performance, efficiency, and accuracy. The research conducted for this project was later presented and published in an international conference in Spain.
